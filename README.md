Fixes some small minor stuff about vanilla dispatch without overly changing stuff about it, also comes with better responses too

Vanilla Dispatch Tweaks & Fixes
This one fixes some issues and also enhances dispatch
Fixes:
Fixed SWAT_JEEP army response spawning soldiers with no armor (model changed to marine 03)
Fixed annihilators not spawning, R* prob forgot to change POLICE_HELI_1 to POLICE_HELI_2 in 4-5 stars
speaking of that, 5 stars replace pursuing helis to annihilators
Tweaks:
Detection is now 0.0, so no instant detection (might not work)
ParoleDuration is now 12000 if using GTA 4 Wanted Radius
Wanted Level 5 hidden evasion timer is infinite, so i'd recommend using GTA 4 Wanted Radius, or change it to some another value
Law Spawn Delays tweaked, see values in <LawSpawnDelayMin>
FIB and NOOSE added, the game will pick 1 of them once per chase, meaning 1 time you can be chased by FIB or another time by NOOSE.
Regular cops are rare at 4 stars, usually 4 units spawn, at 5 stars they don't spawn at all unless spawned by roadblock or ambient.
